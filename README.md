## 📌 Problem Statement & Motivation

Many individuals lack sufficient credit history, making it difficult for banks to assess loan eligibility fairly. Traditional credit scoring systems often exclude legitimate borrowers, while approving high-risk applicants can lead to significant financial losses.

This project addresses the challenge of binary loan default classification — predicting whether an applicant is likely to default on a loan. The goal is to build a model that:

- Minimizes risky approvals (optimizes for recall on the default class)
- Ensures fairness using income, employment, and credit history features
- Provides regulatory-compliant explainability using SHAP values
- Deploys as an interactive web application for real-world use

## 🔬 Methodology Overview

The project follows the complete Data Science Project Life Cycle.

### Stage 1 — Problem Definition & Literature Review

Defined the binary classification problem to predict loan default risk. Studied literature related to credit risk modelling, class imbalance handling, explainable AI, and regulatory compliance in banking systems.

### Stage 2 — Data Collection & Understanding

- Loaded dataset using Pandas
- Explored shape, datatypes, missing values, and target distribution
- Identified severe class imbalance in the dataset

### Stage 3 — Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

- Removed columns with more than 50% missing values
- Applied median imputation for numerical features
- Applied mode imputation for categorical features
- Performed log transformation using `np.log1p()` for income distribution normalization

### Stage 4 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed visual analysis using:

- Count plots for loan default distribution
- Boxplots for income comparison
- Correlation heatmaps
- Credit score vs default analysis
- Feature relationship visualization

### Stage 5 — Feature Engineering & Selection

Created engineered features such as:

```python
LOAN_TO_INCOME_RATIO = AMT_CREDIT / AMT_INCOME_TOTAL
```

Selected important features based on:

- Correlation analysis
- Domain relevance
- Model importance

Dataset was split using stratified train-test splitting (80/20).

### Stage 6 — Model Building & Training

Three machine learning models were trained and compared.

| Model | Configuration |
|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | `class_weight='balanced'` |
| Random Forest | 300 trees with max depth |
| LightGBM | Gradient boosting with imbalance handling |

#### Handling Class Imbalance

- SMOTE applied on training data
- Balanced class weights used
- `scale_pos_weight` used in LightGBM

#### Data Scaling

`StandardScaler` applied after SMOTE processing.

### Stage 7 — Model Evaluation & Comparison

Models evaluated using:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC

Primary optimization target: **Recall**, to reduce false negatives and risky loan approvals.

#### Evaluation Visualizations

- Confusion matrices
- ROC curves
- Precision-Recall curves

### Stage 8 — Explainability Using SHAP

Implemented SHAP explainability for model transparency.

- Used `shap.TreeExplainer`
- Generated SHAP summary plots
- Identified important predictors affecting loan default

Top impactful features:

- `EXT_SOURCE_2`
- `LOAN_TO_INCOME_RATIO`
- `AMT_CREDIT`
- `AMT_INCOME_TOTAL`

### Stage 9 — Streamlit Deployment

Built a complete interactive Streamlit application with:

- Applicant input forms
- Real-time prediction
- Risk classification
- Probability gauge charts
- Model comparison tables
- Recommendation system
- Live metrics display

### Stage 10 — Documentation

Project includes:

- Jupyter notebook documentation
- Streamlit deployment app
- Requirements file
- Complete GitHub README

## 📈 Results Summary

### Model Comparison

| Model | Strength | Weakness |
|---|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | Fast and interpretable | Lower recall |
| Random Forest | Good precision | Slower inference |
| LightGBM | Best recall and ROC-AUC | Slightly less interpretable |

### Key Findings

- `EXT_SOURCE_2` is the strongest predictor of default
- Engineered features improved prediction performance
- SMOTE significantly improved minority class recall
- Threshold tuning improved high-risk detection
